Website Chatbot
Overview

The Website Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to interact with users by answering questions based on the content of any website. By simply providing a URL, the chatbot scrapes the website's content, processes it using Ollama AI, and stores the data in Chroma DB for efficient retrieval. The chatbot leverages Cheerio for web scraping and provides accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.

This project is ideal for developers, researchers, or anyone looking to build a conversational AI that can dynamically interact with web content.
